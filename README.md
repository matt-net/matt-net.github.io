Hello, world!

First and foremost, I love writing code. My first experience with coding was a simple pathfinding program in C. Despite its bugs, it was an unforgettable learning experience. Since then, I've been passionate about using software to solve problems and improve lives.

### My Journey

Analog modulation sparked my interest in communication. Implementing Turbo codes in MATLAB was my first bug-free project in wireless communication. This experience showed me the power of programming to tackle real-world challenges.

### Professional Experience

As a Python developer in the stock market industry, I honed my skills in machine learning. I developed RL agents for discrete and continuous action spaces, as well as multi-agent scenarios.

### Current Focus

I have recently completed my Ph.D. and am now engaged in a postdoctoral position at the University of York. My research focuses on advancing wireless communications through the exploration of novel GenAI applications, particularly in the realm of RL algorithms for 5G and beyond.

### Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, familiar with Julia, MATLAB
- **Reinforcement Learning**: DQN, Actor-Critic, Multi-agent RL, GenAI, cGAN
- **Optimization**: Convex optimization, Bayesian optimization
