Hello, world!

First and foremost, I love writing codes. My first experience with coding was a simple pathfinding programme in C. Even though the code I wrote was full of bugs, it was an experience I will never forget. Since then, I was obsessed with the idea of using software to solve problems. People's lives can be transformed and improved by programming, which I believe in deeply. 

It was analog modulation that introduced me to the world of communication. The transformation of the signal without a wired interface was fascinating to me. Up until now, when I am completing my Ph.D. research, communication has always been my passion. In wireless communication, my first bug-free implementation was implementing Turbo codes in MATLAB, and when my code was compiled, I realized how interesting it is to solve real-world problems through programming.

During my time as a Python developer for a stock company, my programming skills were honed. Working in such an unpredictable environment forced me to learn Machine learning and I observed how machines can learn things that are difficult for humans to grasp. I developed RL agents both in discrete and continuous action space as well as multi-agent cases. 

While completing my Ph.D. at the University of Kent, I am doing research into different kinds of RL algorithms in 5G and beyond. Developing new wireless communications ideas and discovering new ways to use machine learning are the two things that keep me awake and make me stay up late at night.

Language: Python, Familiar with Julia, MATLAB (If it is called a programming language!)
Skills: Reinforcement learing familily: DQN, Actor Critic, Multi-agent RL, Convex optimisation, Bayesian Optimisation .
